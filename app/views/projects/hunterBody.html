            <div>
                <p>
                    As a college of the City University of New York (CUNY), the systems and information that Hunter students need are split between CUNY and Hunter websites. This disjointed experience is confusing, frustrating, and often leads to missed opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make matters worse, Hunter’s website was built 10 years ago on an unfriendly CMS. Instead of using it, many of Hunter’s departments created their own websites, but they’ve struggled to keep information consistent and accurate over time.

                    To rein in their departments, Hunter asked VGD to help consolidate the information that undergraduate students need for academic and financial planning. That included building responsive templates with a new CMS, which would be leveraged to update their entire website later on.

                    As the UX/Product Architect, I directed our process from research through design. I was also responsible for collaborating with stakeholders, communicating all findings and solutions, while addressing their questions. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I conducted all user and stakeholder research and developed the information architecture, wireframes, and early prototypes for the site. Later on, I directed developers to build additional prototypes and designers to create high fidelity designs.

                    After being briefed on the project, I asked Hunter staff to walk me through the sites and systems students have to use. They also shared a report on Hunter students conducted by an independent researcher before I was brought on.

                <p>
                    Hunter had a general idea of what they wanted; a section of the website consolidating the information students’ need to succeed.

                    I used Adobe Muse to create a rough prototype of their concept and went to campus to test with students.
